        <p>Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.
            Web development is a specific field of software engineering that focuses on building web pages. Web pages, or web apps, are codebases that are downloaded and run in our web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) each time a user navigates to the website address. This differs from other software which is usually downloaded once and run as a standalone application on your computer or phone. Web development makes for an exciting career, as a web development cycle is usually much shorter and you get to iterate over your software at a much faster rate.

The major building blocks of the web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be talking about all three languages. We can also think of web development as being split into two main categories: front end and back end. We will discuss what each entails.
